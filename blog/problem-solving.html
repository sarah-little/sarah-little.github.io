      <h2 class="header-tag">Getting blocked on a problem<h2>
          <p>
            I got blocked on the Fizzbuzz kata on Repl. I had written my pseudocode, and got partway through the exercise tests successfully, when I had trouble passing the correct values into the array for the remaining tests.
          </p>
          <p>
              I tried lots of different things, I read the error messages, I tried logging the information on the console, googling the problem (as I saw it), and checked the slack channel for others who had had a similar block on fizzbuzz.
          </p>
          <p>
              I found this a bit frustrating, as I felt I was spinning my wheels a bit, and as though I couldn't find the right questions to ask. I tried to accept the fact that I wouldn't know some things, and I learnt that this was surprisingly hard - turns out I am quite stubborn!
          </p>
      <h2 class="header-tag">Solving a problem in an elegant way</h2>
          <p>
                There were no particular problems during the fourth sprint that I felt I had solved in an elegant way. After writing the pseudocode, it felt like trying to use a hammer to screw in a nail - I just kind of kept hitting at it until it did what it was meant to. It is highly likely that this will change as my experience level increases, as its hard to know what elegance in coding is until you know enough to appreciate what elegance looks like and see multiple examples. 
          </p>
          <p>
              However, I did surprisingly enjoy the Zen Garden challenge - I learned that reformatting the code to align with conventions was immensely satisfying for the perfectionism side.
          </p>
          <p>
              I felt okay about not being elegant, as refactoring and refining code is something that will improve with time. It can feel very satisfying to output an elegant work though, whether in code or other activities - it is that small glimpse of pride that comes from seeing yourself create something swish. 
          </p>
      <h2 class="header-tag">Reflections on using different problem solving techniques/processes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode -</strong> this is the first time I have seen this suggested as a problem solving approach directly, but to me it ties in with the idea of Test Driven Development and Unit testing – It's the thinking about the problem before moving to actually solve it. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The rubber ducky method –</strong> I looked at this in the prep curriculum and it made me laugh – I feel like I have those conversations all the time, but normally not out loud. I have a Taurus-shaped stress squeeze animal that I am using as a rubber ducky substitute for this purpose, but again I tend to talk out loud in my head rather than using my outside voice lol.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages –</strong> this I have found somewhat useful in the past – sometimes error messages can be too generic or broad to be helpful, and the myriad of solutions can send you down a bit of a rabbit hole trying to find the one that applies to your situation. But, they do add a piece to the problem solving puzzle – like a detective using a clue to narrow down what the perpetrator is.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging -</strong> I am slowly becoming more familiar with this, though there is a lot to still learn about this (which I sense may come up more in bootcamp?).
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Googling –</strong> the most universal verb and answer to any question – just Google it! It can be quite frustrating wading through answers that turn out to not be relevant though, this is a huge time-suck sometimes, but other times leads to really interesting info that you wouldn't have looked for otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something –</strong> Experimentation is key to learning, and it all counts as practise. This can be  time suck but I find it is often where the most learning is cemented.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help -</strong> this is always a good way to learn, but it can be confronting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help -</strong> I like that the facilitators at EDA will guide your questioning, but not necessarily give you all the answers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection –</strong> the only down side I see with this is that you don’t know what you don’t know – if you’ve been stuck on something for a while it can be hard to find a gap in the process through reflection, as you’re already operating from a blinkered perspective. Having said that though, there is definitely a benefit to reflecting, and often just the clarifying of your thoughts can lead to breakthroughs on the problem. In this way it ties in with the Rubber-Ducky method, but is retrospective and introspective, rather than pre-emptive or happening in the moment.
