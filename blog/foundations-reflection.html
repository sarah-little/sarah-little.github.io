      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        That I am very hard on myself – that I often unfortunately feel justified in this hardness, and that I spend way too much time thinking about myself (ego). Also, I have genuine feelings of anxiety and terror about working with others, even though I know that I shouldn’t, and haven’t in the past.   
      </p>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Values help you to identify your starting point, and direct your angle of learning. Most people find it easier to learn things that they deem important, so if it is important to you because it aligns with your values, then you will put more into it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy plays a very key role, for both yourself and others. To approach others with empathy in programming is important because often programming can seem quite clinical, and interacting kindly with general humans and being aware of what makes people do the things they do, and what they are trying to achieve can be quite humbling. Also, making something that makes life easier or more accessible for others is a really great thing, and you need empathy in order to realise what other peoples life journeys involve.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is huge in learning and programming. If you don’t take the time to check in with your self, the consequences can be high. Knowing your strengths and embracing your current shortcomings can really affect how well you perform in any aspect of life. Plus, if you don’t know how you learn best, it’ll be hard to successfully achieve what you want to do. It’s like wearing the wrong pair of shoes when you are trying to run a marathon – you’re making it hard for yourself, but at the end of the day its still you who has to do the running.  
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not sure I was really surprised so much as interested – the neuroplasticity in terms of even just knowing it existed changes the outcome, was probably the most interesting thing. It has also been more comprehensive than perhaps was expected, in terms of the broad range of topics covered. 
      </p>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely self-awareness, empathy for self and sharing the journey with others. As above, I have had trouble reaching out or connecting with my cohort, but that’s a reflection of my own habits. I am forever trying to improve the self-kindness. 
      </p>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        Because soft skills are what is important in the workplace/industry. We are all humans and it is our human interactions that ultimately shape our career/work lives. Also, self-discovery can’t be taught, it has to be explored. By making a safe and welcoming space for these explorations to happen, ultimately you end up with more complete and functional humans in the tech-sphere. It is also a way of paying-it-forward, in that society benefits from more emotionally intelligent people and actions.  
      </p>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?</h3>
      <p>
        The core time doesn’t feel like a waste of time, but I also see some benefits to just practicing programming instead. There are real benefits in spending time on the core subjects, as ultimately these lead to more capable and flexible programmers. It also makes you a better programmer by giving you strategies - for resolving issues, finding resilience, identifying gaps in your learning, figuring out when to ask for help, working with others – which all help you make better code output in the end. Having said that, I could use infinite practice time for coding, so the more the better! 
      </p>
      <p>
        The core curriculum also helps keep the human health equilibrium, by reminding you that programming isn’t everything, and sitting still on a computer all day is no way to live a life! It encourages more balance and a holistic perspective, to help people from getting too engrossed.
