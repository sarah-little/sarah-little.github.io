      <h3>Initial thoughts:</h3>
      <p>
          Your brain is like any other muscle in your body, and can grow with use or shrink/deteriorate with disuse accordingly. 
      </p>
      <h3>After looking around:</h3>
      <p>
        To me this definition was the clearest and most concise 
        <span>
            <a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being" _blank>"the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior"</a>
          </span>
        So, pretty neat. And promising for the human existence.
      <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
          <p>
            It benefits them physically – by strengthening the same motor cortex (movement) neurons that doing the actual activity would. It also can be quite mentally freeing for people, 
            because it can help them shed a sense of burden or lack of potential (feeling ‘not-smart’) and realise that change is always possible. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who are recovering from a medical event, it also brings a sense of hope – that their currently decreased faculties are not necessarily permanent, as significant positive changes can be achieved. 
            This would also lead to increased feelings resilience – knowing that even if you hadn’t achieved something yet, it is still always a possibility by overcoming or engaging with effort and difficulty. 
          </p>
      <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
          <p>
            I’d like to mentally practice coding, as well as finding ways to retrain my brain out of anxious reactions. 
          </p>
      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
          <p>
            Learning or trying to do a new thing is the best way to increase neuroplasticity. 
            The new thing needs to be: 
          </p>
          <ul>
                <li>Challenging/ a novelty – new to you and not too easy to learn (what)</li>
                <li>An intention – have some meaning, importance or relevance to you so that you feel rewarded while doing it (why).</li>
                <li>Specific – it will need focused or scheduled attention (how)</li>
                <li>Repetitive and have intensity – do it for shorter bouts and often, and check in on progress with yourself (who do = you)</li>
                <li>Focused longer term – be patient, as it takes time, and lapses happen (when). Refocusing is helpful and also compassion for yourself</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I found <span><a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being" _blank>this link</a></span> particularly useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            A question for later research is do those with white matter disorders have trouble learning new things/confirmed reduction in neuroplasticity and if so, how does that affect them and their outlook? Are there known ways around it?
          </p>
      
      <h2>What is 'Growth Mindset' and why is it relevant?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s the ability to believe that your intelligence is not fixed, and that it can be changed at any time.
          It's relevant, because we are on a learning journey here at EDA, and a growth mindset will help determine the outcome of
          and engagement with that journey.
        </p>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </h2>
        <p>
          I was surprised at how even just becoming aware of the growth mindset was enough to change outcomes. However, I had done some research during the prep work, so the surprise had also worn off a bit :)
          This didn’t change anything for me yet (yet intended!). 
        </p>
      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          In some ways I already have, but the mindfulness and refocusing will be key. I had always worked under the assumption that being harsh toward myself and always expecting more of myself was necessary to remain motivated, achieving and competitive. 
          When I am late (which I frequently am to things – I can be a serial late-ist) I tend to apologize profusely, and then barrage myself with self-deprecation and criticism.  This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle whereby I am so cruel to myself that I self-defeat, 
          which was so frustrating because I would be aware I was doing it, but unable to stop myself. The part I was lacking was the self-compassion after the self-awareness. The way to integrate this into my learning journey is through daily mindfulness 
          practices in the morning or evening, and frequent reflections/journalling. Additionally, self-compassion statements to acknowledge that lapses are normal and refocusing is achievable. 
        </p>
        <p>I found <span><a href="https://matterapp.com/blog/how-to-develop-a-growth-mindset-10-strategies-to-success" _blank>this resource</a></span> particularly useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these strategies were already incorporated into my learning plan, but I have realised that the need for self-compassion is quite high, 
          so I will refocus on the daily mindfulness activities and reflections/journalling.
