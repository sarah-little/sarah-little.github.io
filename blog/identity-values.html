            <h3>Identity</h3>
            <p>Ko Tangihua te maunga</p>
            <p>Ko Wairoa te awa</p>
            <p>Ko Te Uri O Hau te iwi</p>
            <p>Ko Otamatea te Marae</p>
            <p>
                I identify as a New Zealander, of mixed European (Dutch/English/Scottish) 
                and Maori (Te Uri O Hau/Ngapuhi) descent. I am immensely privileged to have grown up in NZ!

            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p>I value respect, honesty and intent. I believe in treating people as fairly and as kindly as I can.

            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
                My strengths are learning things, delivering/taking personal responsibility, analysis, empathy and 
                solving problems, according to the High5 assessment (alternative to Strengthfinder). 
                These hold firm in terms of my learning development (Ilike to know things) and in terms of career development
                 â€“ I have always enjoyed working with data and figuring out problems, and would often be the person who just went ahead and got things done.
            </p>        
            <p>
                In the DOPE model of strengthfinding, I am an Owl - logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes a perfectionist that loves details.
