            <h3>Long term goal/Career pathway</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to be able to work remotely, in a flexible and creative career.
                 I appreciate outcomes rather than attendance, so would prefer flexible work hours.</p>

            <h3>Description of personal learning strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>My strengths are learning things, delivering/taking personal responsibility, analysis, empathy and solving problems, according to the High5 assessment (alternative to Strengthfinder). These hold firm in terms of my learning development (Ilike to know things) and in terms of career development – I have always enjoyed working with data and figuring out problems, and would often be the person who just went ahead and got things done.  </p>
            <p>In terms of my learning journey, being a philomath is great as learning comes quite naturally, but it does also present obstacles in that I deep dive/get distracted easily, and this may also be a challenge when it comes to keeping to timeframes and just-in-time learning. I think also that analysis/problem solving will help as it will help me look for where I’ve gone wrong and help me find solutions independently. It could also mean that I don’t ask for help when I should though, which is a potential obstacle. </p>

            <h3>Development of skills</h3>
            <p>I would like to develop my ability to make decisions (I am prone to analysis paralysis), working in a team environment (I am a natural introvert), as well as tension/conflict resolution (finding a way to move forward together). 
                I have come across many different people in my walk of life so far, and I always feel privileged to learn something from each of them. I’m aiming to be more open to this going forward.
                Finally, it would be great to replace my existing tendency toward conformity, with creativity and self-assuredness.

            <h3>Workload commitment</h3>
            <p>
                The aim is to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives.
                To achieve this, I will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to do what I say</li>
                <li>Have regular check-ins with my facilitator</li>
                <li>Check and be active on Slack every week day</li>
                <li>Adhere to the timeboxes</li>
                <li>Help enable other learners through encouragement or appropriate feedback.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If things are building up or starting to get to me, I will discuss this with my facilitator, either directly at the time, or during our weekly check-ins.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How to get help</h3>
            <p>If I find an obstacle that is taking more than 15 minutes or so to self-resolve, I will seek help through the foundations channel, or directly from other cohort members or my facilitator.</p>
            <p>I expect the facilitation team to participate in my learning journey through regular check-ins and responses to messages.
             If I am stuck, I would like guidance on how to re-frame the obstacle.    
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
           <h3>Schedule information</h3> 
           <p>Generally I will be available 9am to 5pm weekdays, excluding some blocked-out time for medical appointments scheduled throughout the month.</p>
