            <h2>BootCamp</h2>
            <h3>Building on the learning plan from Foundations</h3>
            <P>
                I still want to work remotely as a web developer because I find it creative and interesting. I want to work for a company that cares about the world we live in and that creates sites for helping people. I am hoping that EDA will help to re-orient me into the industry, so that I have a chance to meet and work alongside some interesting and talented people. 
            </P>
            <p>
                My biggest strengths will be thinking of unusual analogies for coding activities, and my limitations will be that I am severely introverted, so working with others is very daunting. These are in addition to the below ones. 
            </p>
                The biggest non-technical challenge will be that I find it very intimidating working with and asking for help from others. I think it will also be a challenge to stay on top of the material, and keep focused on the end goal rather than particular activities within each Sprint. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to find it easier to work with others, and to feel comfortable asking for help when I need to. Giving and receiving feedback would be great to improve, and also working on leadership skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My expectations from the bootcamp team are that they make themselves available during usual hours to answer any burning questions, and that they also ease the way for collaborating in group or pair activities. This is something I will need support on in order to improve. Also, I expect that the Bootcamp team know the course content well, and practice it in useful ways in their daily lives. 
            </p>
            <ul>My expectations of myself for bootcamp are to:</ul>
                <li>
                    Get into a regular routine where I make myself available for the set times for the full duration of the course, and put in regular time outside of the schedule to strengthen the concepts covered. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Complete the course content to the best of my ability and revisit any areas I feel less confident about.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attend all check-ins and tech-ins to make the most of the knowledge and support available to me. 
                </li>
         </div>
        <div>
             <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <h3>Long term goal/Career pathway</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to be able to work remotely, in an adaptable and creative career.
                 I appreciate outcomes rather than attendance, so would prefer flexible work hours.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Description of personal learning strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>My strengths are learning things, delivering/taking personal responsibility, analysis, empathy and solving problems, according to the High5 assessment (alternative to Strengthfinder). These hold firm in terms of my learning development (Ilike to know things) and in terms of career development – I have always enjoyed working with data and figuring out problems, and would often be the person who just went ahead and got things done.  </p>
            <p>In terms of my learning journey, being a philomath is great as learning comes quite naturally, but it does also present obstacles in that I deep dive/get distracted easily, and this may also be a challenge when it comes to keeping to timeframes and just-in-time learning. I think also that analysis/problem solving will help as it will help me look for where I’ve gone wrong and help me find solutions independently. It could also mean that I don’t ask for help when I should though, which is a potential obstacle. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Development of skills</h3>
            <p>I would like to develop my ability to make decisions (I am prone to analysis paralysis), working in a team environment (I am a natural introvert), as well as tension/conflict resolution (finding a way to move forward together). 
                I have come across many different people in my walk of life so far, and I always feel privileged to learn something from each of them. I’m aiming to be more open to this going forward.
                Finally, it would be great to replace my existing tendency toward conformity, with creativity and self-assuredness.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Workload commitment</h3>
            <p>
                The aim is to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives.
                To achieve this, I will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to do what I say</li>
                <li>Have regular check-ins with my facilitator</li>
                <li>Check and be active on Slack every week day</li>
                <li>Adhere to the timeboxes</li>
                <li>Help enable other learners through encouragement or appropriate feedback.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If things are building up or starting to get to me, I will discuss this with my facilitator, either directly at the time, or during our weekly check-ins.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How to get help</h3>
            <p>The suggested rule was that if an obstacle is taking more than 15 minutes or so to self-resolve, 
                I will seek help through the foundations channel, or directly from other cohort members or my facilitator.</p>
            <p>I expect the facilitation team to participate in my learning journey through regular check-ins and responses to messages.
             If I am stuck, I would like guidance on how to re-frame the obstacle.    
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
           <h3>Schedule information</h3> 
           <p>Generally I will be available 10am to 6pm weekdays, excluding some blocked-out time for medical appointments scheduled throughout the month.</p>
