    <p>What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>

      <h3>Initial thoughts:</h3>
      <p>
          It may be helpful to examine my current knowledge/perspective on what emotional intelligence is, before seeking to expand it.
          Emotional Intelligence (or sometimes called emotional quotient or emotional literacy) is the ability that people have to understand and relate to their own and others emotions. 
          I have met many people and it is the ones who can (from a place of curiosity and respect) bring out true feelings of connection and balance in the interaction, who I view as emotionally intelligent. 
          They are self aware, but more than that, they also have empathy for others and know what form that empathy needs to take for the current interaction. 
          Also, they can express their feelings in comfortable and clear ways, using words that somehow fit well when they say them.
          I don’t think I have a particularly high EQ – I feel things very deeply, but where I struggle is in expressing my own emotions calmly and non-judgementally. 
      </p>
      <h3>After looking around:</h3>
      <p>
        To me this definition was the clearest and most concise 
        <span>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+emotional+intelligence&sxsrf=ALeKk00aVp5izc5CB6Cd1AzUsGwUUP_XfA%3A1625531375856&ei=76PjYJ_oM4WK4-EP3f-TkA0&oq=define+emotio&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIFCAAQkQIyBQgAEJECMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgcIABCHAhAUMgUIABCRAjICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoJCCMQJxBGEPkBOggIABCxAxCDAUoECEEYAFDeYVivgQFgiY8BaAFwAngAgAHpAYgB-ReSAQUwLjcuOJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz" _blank>"the capacity to be aware of, control and express one's emotions and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically."
          </span>
        So it turned out that I wasn't too far off. There are five key ingredients to emotional intelligence:
        <ul>
            <li>Self-awareness - knowing or being aware of how you feel, and how that can affect your actions or those around you. <br>
              Strangely enough, this involves having clarity on your own strengths and weaknesses, and suggested ways to improve are keeping a journal and pausing to notice your feelings - likely why EDA have included this in the Core curriculum.
                  </li>
            <li>Self-regulation - staying in control. This helps avoid outbursts or verbal attacks, stereotyping people, or making rushed decisions based on emotions.<br>
                  Being able to self-regulate means knowing your values/what is important to you, holding yourself accountable (avoid blaming others) and practising calmness.</li>
            <li>Motivation - working consistently towards goals, with high standards for results.<br>
                  To improve motivation, re-examine why you want to achieve the goal, know how motivated you are to start with (so that you can take steps to improve if needed) and practise optimism.</li>
            <li>Empathy - putting yourself in someone else's situation. To improve your empathy, learn how to read body language and examine your own, respond to the other persons feelings in a kind and considerate way.</li>
            <li>Social skills - the ability to relate to, influence, or engage with other people. <br>
                  These skills can be built by learning conflict resolution to help manage change or tension, communicating well (not everyone hears the same thing as what you think you are saying), and providing praise or feedback for others.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
      <p>
          Whereas the traditional measure of intelligence (IQ) is standardised (able to be repeatedly tested objectively) and has been around for a long time, emotional intelligence (EQ) as a concept wasn't really defined until much later. 
          IQ focuses on logical academic abilities, and defines a level of mental prowess (from geniuses to those with mental impairments).
          EQ focuses more on personal and social abilities, and defines how people may operate mentally in conjunction with others. 
          Emotional intelligence can be an indicator for success in a workplace or other social institutions and can highlight those who may be good leaders, good team players or work best alone.
          EQ is not as easy to measure or quantify, as there is much more scope for variation in people, and it can be seen as somewhat subjective (heavily affected by personal or situational factors).
          </p>
      <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
      <p>
          Emotional intelligence is important because humans don’t just think, but feel emotions as well, in a myriad of ways.
          don't exist in isolation/solitude. Ours is a complex blended society, and in order to navigate that complexity, we need to have knowledge of how to relate to others.<br>
          An understanding of EQ is important for resolving conflicts, bringing out the best performance in people, creating healthy relationships or teams, and for moderating one’s own emotions.
          All these things are key to live a rich and enjoyable human life and can have a direct influence on your level of happiness.<br>
          Finally, emotional intelligence is important as we will need to be able to tell actual humans from weaponised AI enhanced cybertron replicas in the future...
