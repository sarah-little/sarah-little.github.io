    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h2>
<p>When working with styles in CSS, it is important to understand the difference between these three things. All items (text, images, tables, shapes, colour blocks etc) on a web-page are called elements.</p>
<p>First, the actual definitions as they relate to style on web pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Margin - the space outside/around the outer edge of elements</li>
    <li>Border - the outer or defining edge of an element. (The 'edge' can be invisible, but will always exist). </li>
    <li>Padding - the inner area of space between any content and it's border/edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to think of it in terms of a human body - that is:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Elements = your inside core (internal organs, bones, muscles etc)</li>
<li>Margin = your personal space, i.e. how far your arms can reach to fend off anything that wants to get at your bod, or the distance you choose to social distance from other humans.</li>
<li>Border = your skin. Some people are said to have thick skin - they just have a border with good depth!</li>
<li>Padding = the fatty tissue between your internal organs and your skin. Pad it up, people!!</li>

<p>Hopefully this analogy helps clarify! Or at least makes it mildly amusing to recall</p>
